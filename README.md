## Note/Paster: I have no idea what I should name this project

I build this project because I need a place where I can throw a bunch of text without having to open any other apps (e.g. Notes, Notion, etc). I just open this website from the already opened browser, and ready to rock.

As simple, as that. But it saves my moods, and time A LOT.

## Usage

Visit [https://notes.hisamafahri.com].

## Build your own

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hisamafahri/notes
cd notes
yarn # or: npm install

yarn dev # or: npm run dev
```

The app will be availble on [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000).
